Hey, I'm Marija - Masha! I am a Junior Research Group Leader at the University of Bonn and Cluster of Excellence "PhenoRob". Before starting in Bonn, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Smart Robotics Lab at Imperial College London, UK (Dec 2019 - Jan 2021). I received my Ph.D. titled "Environmental Mapping and Informative Path Planning for UAV-based Active Sensing" from the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland (Sep 2015 - Oct 2019) and did my Master in Engineering in Integrated Mechanical & Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath, UK (Sep 2011 - Jun 2015). I am originally from Belgrade, Serbia, but have lived in 7 different countries.

My research is centred around developing algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making for autonomous mobile robots, both aerial and ground. My research group in the DFG Cluster of Excellence PhenoRob focuses on furthering robot autonomy in agricultural applications. Our current topics span planning/coordination, environmental mapping, and computer vision for decision-making.
