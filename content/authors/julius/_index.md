Hey, I am Julius! I am a Doctoral student in Robotics at the University of Bonn and Cluster of Excellence "PhenoRob" since February 2021. Before starting in Bonn, I did my Master in Mathematics in Data Science at the Technical University of Munich, Germany (Oct 2018 - Dec 2020). In the 2019 season, I led a team of computer science and engineering students to build an autonomous formula racecar that competed in international Formula Student competitions. During my Master's, I worked for Merantix Momentum (Berlin, Germany), a machine-learning solutions provider, as a Machine Intelligence Engineer developing machine-learning software for mid-sized enterprises and large corporations.
