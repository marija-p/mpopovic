abstract: This paper presents a localization method for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) equipped with RFID sensors for the monitoring of small indoor areas such as greenhouses. After validating the localization procedure, we perform some experiments aimed to produce thermal mapping in an indoor environment to control and prevent anomalous changes for the plant safety. Moreover, the accuracy of our RFID based localization method is evaluated by comparison with Maplab and Vicon systems, two precise but expensive localization method. We obtained a localization accuracy of Ïƒ = 0.12 m as standard deviation for the RFID localization system, that could be considered adequate for a greenhouse.
