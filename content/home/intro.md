### Welcome to our group page!

Robots often need the capability to understand and reason about their surroundings in order to reach their goals. Our junior research group focuses on developing robotic systems that can sense, learn about, and act intelligently in different environments to perform useful tasks. We want to answer the question: how should an autonomous agent behave in an uncertain enviornment to maximise the utility of its actions within the set of its resource constraints? In other words, how can a desired mission be executed most efficiently? Our current research fields span planning/coordination, environmental mapping, and computer vision for decision-making. Our key applciation area is agriculture robotics (both aerial and ground) in context of the  <a href="http://phenorob.de">DFG Cluster of Excellence PhenoRob</a>. Our lab is part of the <a href="https://www.igg.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en">Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en">University of Bonn</a>. Marija Popović leads the junior research group.
